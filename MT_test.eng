where
you want to mess with this (but) it's bad old stuff (joking with them and Eugênio) thirato=de verdade
He just threw it, he was leaving
thank you, thank you
humm
you look too
(she) was telling the truth
back then there was that brand of cachaça 'human' armadillo (kidding about himself)
that guy
about cleaning up, sometimes when we're done in the afternoon (ML-P)
coming slowly against the current
to talk with her
like this
I'll never do anything like that again,
"he said that" I said
Actually, he was drunk
that one (girl) too, that Dominique, right?
she also wanted to come here, she wanted me to be
This one is worthless
it seems so, his wife did, but she
"I want to relax a bit" I thought (to myself)
hã
if you start working, when we start with a thread, it starts (taking shape)
this one here goes here, right?
realizing that, as I was sitting there
he has some things over here
How did they put the decoration on the flutes?
"I gave this much to you" he said
it's a painful memory (thought)
she's showing her skills
no, seems just with three and a half
"chu! I have fifty (lts)" I told him
"I wil never do such things any more,
where he comes back thinking
this afternoon
a thought came
and said
yeah
I was thinking that
"did you really do that?"
uh-huh
I will never drink like that," I said
these look like lawyers, don't they?
I'm going to play ball. Are you working, auntie?
my mother-in-law?
"take me (to Mitu)" he asked
this here (the objects in the man's hands) I would say are like sandals
There are only five, right?
that really is the right centimeter (the right size)
here's her
it might be a stove
sitting right there
Uh-hum
there's already firewood there
they're my friends (joking)
this with his thinking, it's in this place (in the sequence)
I'm going to send it to the militars
what? Oh, I'm not doing much of anything
some things
she was off with another guy" they said to him, see?
Yeah
Actually, it's so heavy, it didn't come up not even a little bit
he did?
It would be better to tight it again
which?
to give to Silvio, that he asked for
as if you're telling
didn't pay, it was new
This one here also has to be closed
you came up according to the weight (of the gas and cargo)
they were going to sell it
Ok
just acompanying
Gay
yeah
Early, he took his riffle and left, according to what his brother said
that was for sure his wife
yes, ele went back to live with his family
I talked with my wife
It's not
that's right, yeah
these are the ones she brought (RC)
Without anything, she just came back
I will send a group
I need to get it, right? right away
and where I was sitting sleeping there were so many mosquitos"
"look at how much it is" he said "really full"
That one's brand is really good
You use urucum to paint this kind of thing
those ones (packs of foodstuffs) there
we're documenting her work
for me, it goes here, right?
I think that's it, right?
an old guy did that to me
(and) these
ãha
here is where
it's good
with lawyers (REP)
told them
you said
so, you're mother-in-law is, doesn't recognize you any more, does she, dona Kiri?
look, these, these (idiots) are drinking
ok, give it to me
wow, how did that happen to him?
got money and I had that money
that's good, that
as a prisoner there, he's sitting thinking
franci
I don't know, your father (nickname monkey, talking about Daniel Trindade) hasn't come yet either
laughs
I drank one (bottle)
It is 100 hours
these are a family, right? could they be?
And using a canoe like this, with that kind of bow
that's right (and) these too
ʉhʉ̃
there's nothing here for me"
Of this size?
I sat with them
It's okay, fat old man
is there more over there?
turi(h) (sound of the boat running out of gas)
It's good to put it together with fishing line
how
times, three, four times and it's enough
Uh-hum
is that how you see it?
he really is a prisoner here
What?
like this, yes
to Khaapi (someone's nickname) found it really funny
ãha
after I put the community leaders (ML-P)
yes
It's really heavy
this one here?
the one he's with his friends
she's even faster, she herself invents how (to make new objects/shapes)
she's accusing him
oh yeah, I can see it
pulling in (to the port) ((shows how much gas there is))
he thinks these things
(laughs)
ok, put it in
(laughs)
So?
saying that, I
Uh-hum
Okay
in the dew
yelled at me because of the green snake (somebody's nickname) from Puerto Colombia
Felisberto Moreno
humm
tied up
make it very wide and then build up the sides and keep increasing, right?
one guy carried a box, that really big type
remember
I don't think he paid it all
here too, it's almost the same thing
83? 83, when I came back from Colombia, she
then I met up with those guys
I asked
the policemen
they took me to the courtroom and my wife was there
ʉ̃hʉ
wash well, you have to wash well
she's going up there
that's it, that's it, it goes at the end
I went to get his tank, and he gave it to me filled up
(   )
once with Wanderley
uh-huh
we didn't load (the cargo onto the truck), we stayed right there (at the port)
there were policemen, they told them
you have to wash well, right?
there
I guess it's not too hot for him
uh
see(agree)?
(that) we made from our work
uh-huh
Right, Kristine?
really good, the wife (old lady)
Yes
I was sitting there
I turned them down
I will live well with my children"
the soldiers were taking for themselves
we already went to vote, it's not crowded
um-hum
here he drinks with his friends, right here the police arrest him,
yes
that's just what he's thinking about
this one here where he got things to sell, see?
it might be
um-hum
arresting this bad guy
I knew what I did
Come help me a little bit
for me, I don't give him anything
right here
that's what I say
are those the ones, huh?
ãha
I really did it
You guys go over there
but you grew up listening/understanding?
when it dr(ies), leave it one day drying and a night too
I met my old friends after a long time
here where they're working
where she's filming, show how you sew it, show it well
you're already turning the corner, aren't you?
He left
I'm bringing back what was left over from going to the garden
sure do!
his wife or (someone else)
I think that's right
how many (kilos, units) of each kind of food did you make each day?
right, (we'll do it) like you said, the way you did it, like you're saying
yeah, you turn over in the canoe
come, come and drink,
done, how does it look to you?
and this one
that's what I asked her
wow
'noana'
Out of the canoe (on to the rock), cara! (the noise of the generator falling), like this
locked me up, alone, in a dark room
uh-oh, I pulled to hard and broke it
(and) drank a little, sat there drinking
my deceased Desano grandmother ...
It never worked, they've brought it and left it there, even now it stays there
they're going to throw this to the dogs
that's what I'm saying, maybe their gasoline ran out
Okay, over there
here right after, he's
a Yamaha motor
Then, at this time his mother was
it's good, our booze
but it's still not right here
forty I think
This one is going to hold it, right?
ʉʉ̃
took his sandals (and) put him in prison
it wasn't too bad (hard for him)
maybe he's lying down
this other one, I'm not sure what's happening
so I, while I was hitting her
that idiot expected to come up flying?
ahã, he (Nogueira) fills it up to the top
so he's sitting like that, right?
you go taking the ones from the top and throwing, throwing and when you're done, start
Now it's fine
maybe he's a prisoner, the window is up there
Then
(I think) it's the same guy, right?
I'm not sure how much he charged, six or seven thousand, something like that
I think that's it
There were others that pushed it
(laughs)
hã
Uh-hum
(lived) well with my children and wife
wow, who could that be?
I got there
He said he was going to grab bacaba, I don't know if it's patauá
just recently he went down there
Use this one here
what's this here, a closet?
yeah
each of you
uh-huh
getting here just with empty tanks inside (the boat)
for letting that happen, my friends
really flying, just carrying his own stuff, that's it
that's wrong
Yes
earlier today
(laughs)
so, you have, she has to go around, I don't know how many
over here
this is where he was
over here, (where) she's with them
they might be your relatives, they came in a metal boat
Yeah, right
Oh, it will sound really good
hum
"if we stop, how will we row?" he said
It is like this to someone who understand it, to them, it's not that hard
that's it, done
This one they've pushed here
I have no head for (I'm not good at) this
gone
He is saying it (the flute) works
he's thinking
which ones are at the beginning?
ready, where
my wife went to them (the police)
then, when I was leaving
we couldn't lift it, let it there, let's leave
then, it's good
it looks like he's thinking
see the handcuffs?
ready, Kiri
the guy you were talking about left
blue
you arrived? (laughs)
on a rainy day, it softens
maybe it's like this, right?
It's really hard to do it, right?
went
no, autie's not
if if he were dying, maybe if he were dying (otherwise)
where?
he's always thinking about that
when I was asking them, they said "so, ok
"I don't know how I managed to get the boat this far" (talking as if he were Eugênio)
better to save this here
this one
with his son, yes
then in prison, he, yes, he
come hit this thing here
don't ever do that again,
they were just kidding
Uh-hum
To Dario's
(and) sold our things (and) got some money
maybe this one should come back
so it's going back
that's how it ends
yes
I refused the offer (in vain)
Sometimes he wants to go, right? I'm this one from caricu, I'm from caricu
Ok, he said
I stayed there talking with them
The kids took (it ?) away
this one here (a screw) loosened
Yeah
Like this one here?
what? I'm going with the notebook, we are going after the notebook.
that's right, that's right
which is the other(next) one then
to the courthouse
Are there 17 here, huh?
hum
after that
a hundred
"Why?" and then I said "because I'm married to your son."
yeah, he's a prisoner
[ ....] he's a real armadillo (E's nickname), né?
he lies a lot, that's why noone likes him
(the lid)  will be made later
they took me out
at night!
cleaning up (as you go)
That's enough, that's enough
she's crazy. "those aren't things people can do (vote for other people)," I told (her).
laughs
Cow's pie (nickname), laugh in (on?) your own
When it shook, it hit this part here
Where did you send them?
she's bad, she doesn't say she's going to pay soon, it's bad
here where he met his friends (and) didn't want to drink
Like that (or this? - he touches the gerador) one when it arrived, they said they'd pushed it
What's its size? (maybe 'was it reallk 'that' big?)
when they said "come" I said "no,
also like this, what he's thinking, his thinking like this
Mm it's not
Now they do it carelessly
on this card?
Cilia didn't even vote, right?
there with my wife, so happy to be home
I don't drink, I don't feel like drinking" I said to them
that last time, I
inside here (the sequence)
here he's happy with his family
he has chains (handcuffs, restraints) too
he attacked his wife
they (the soldiers) took it all, five boxes I think
that's wrong
I'm making it in this size (wide)
them
OK
Mm
from this plank canoe, it's dangerous it can sink, I'm telling you
after he did that, he
suddenly one of the guys said (that) to me
Came here, it's better if we test it
(laughs)
Mm
taking her soul
up to Campo Alto (.7) kʉrʉa!
it's light (when) empty, just like that we arrived empty
done, let's put it here
"save 2 and a half or 3" he said
The tortoise won the race,
yes
"we could row if we were at the shore," that's what this fine one said, yeah
with them "ok
don't want that to happen to you"
doesn't belong here
he's feeling bad (remorseful)
this is where he comes back thinking
asked, but he was drunk, and hit her
listening to her, I was speechless
meeting up (with the drinkers)
(she) arrived there in São Gabriel, she looked for me, and I went
So, you're here?
(laughs)
the same type
mMm
Come lift it up
so she was definitely accusing him
"you're under arrest"
(laughs)
This and that, huh?
here is where he left (jail), right, right?
so after I went there, I was sitting
It takes rain, it came rusty, and it just stays there
take her soul
clothes they had taken from me
didn't you understand?
it's coming out
you know how to do this (tucum weaving) too?
doing it summarizing
the booze is making it happen
"when they take a photo, they take my soul" she would say
"I'm married to your son" "Who's my son?"
look for it, where is it?
if we start (with that), it's good
he owes you, you should go get gasoline from him (to recuperate some of your loss)
"ok" he said
(Some paint) splashed there
ok, go and see
"come on" they said
Wow
who?
don't ever do that again" they said
He said goodbye, and came here
(laughs)
yes
realizing that, I told them "I will never do that again,
she came through here, came back and went into (the Papuri)
that's what we still need to organize
just this much (left over)
also
in the morning?
yes
from that guy,
the empty ones go down there
at eleven at night, coming up since seven in the morning
yes, right
they're in the square
Paint it with carajuru
The Baniwa's (generator) broke too
here, yes
he didn't speak well
I'm going to put the things to sell, the stuff Lu wanted, she doesn't have to pay
They (the flutes) all break because (someone) sat on them
so, Cilia is really well behaved, isn't she, Kiri?
They will fix it now, I will tell them to fix it now
yes indeed
I have a cold, Kiri
I told them that, told them everything
then with the pen measure (it), measure (it)
never a lack of such invitations
telling the truth
yes
yes, you have to wash well
They will close them later
It will take so long
it (the workshop) is going to last a week (ML-P)
um-hum
ʉhʉ̃
the greeting song (ML-P)
(the one where) he's thinking
These ones' pairs?
It's  heavy, yeah
yes, right here
poor guy
then they gave me another
She wrote it with red ink, right?
they (the students), right?
here they
yes
she needs some things too, said she doesn't have any money
later
(laughs)
he's worthless
put it inside these ones here
they're the ones going around recording?
Where is that cable?
poor thing
they lost it after only using it a month
yeah
White people's ones, uh?
um-hum
You're here, Silia?
"how's it going to be?" he said
when that runs out, (with) another (tank) goes (.5) (using) my fast motor (.5) right up to Marabitana (.4) kʉrʉa!
so it was like this, cousin
(laughs)
This one here is also good
yes
to get the tucum and separate, remember? those fibers, I remember that you had to divide them, right?
Ok, you only need to fix this here, pot belly (?)
If it is 5 hours, yeah, 5 hours exactly, yeah
she's not drunk
yes
so he's wearing a uniform
one more (tank) comes up
vapor
really hot
(now) this one?
ok, then we can go
each day
telling her, and my son
(laughs)
harvesting what he planted
they're drinkers (but) he didn't accept their invitation when they offered
there I asked
there to Turi, staying more around Turi, right?
then it's ready
the one where he is
they took me away (to jail)
I put it directly in the tank
ãha
depends
"like when we're going through the rapids"
It almost busted my balls
this here is his emblem
Let's go now, old people. No one came
gossiped
but he, but he is a consultant (laughs)
so, you're going to look at these
yes, a you'll choose a character
sure, ok
this one (E) is stealing (kidding him)
OK
I called my mother-in-law, she asked
"I need some gasoline" he said "I
here he was working
Then, people just to
the one who is called Terezinha, she is there waiting for you
(Someone) said if he doesn't take her, he is going to die without woman, bachelor
"I'm your mother-in-law?"
gone
just up to that line
If you want to attach these to that, and we- you
that's why Miguel, my relative said
There were only two and two drivers, so there were only 4
waiting, but there was nothing, probably thirsty, maybe she fell in the water too, she's a bit crazy
"hey there!" he said
mmm
these ones
The ones that have pitch go close them
and now here I am"
maybe it's this one
keep it in front, ok
the booze is making this happen to them
The generator
chased (them) off
tell me, are you getting a little tired of making that? leave it (for a while)
these are his thoughts
with the lawyers
I thought about it
Has? (???)
um-hum
Wow, it's true
you understand?
"we came up really heavy" I told our idiot (leader)
he (the guy who didn't pay E for the motor) ordered one from Cesario
uh-huh
It's past its prime, right? (it's finishing)
complete the whole trip, doutora
It's to make a jangada now
it's really dry, hu-hum
it was just enough
(laughs) poor thing
so "don't ever come back here" he (Cesario) said, it was a while ago, he was really mad
"look, our relative" he said
after we got these
He left then. He had remembered (?)
It stayed whole
Is it really charged?
dogs are all fat (and don't chase the chickens)
it was the drink that made me do it"
here's what he was thinking, look
With carajuru (a kind of paint they use on their skin) with urucum (same)
here he's arriving (for the first time)
I'm going to take the bag (for me)
Thank you!
doing this"
two held me
yeah
mm
he's sitting there with his lawyer
ãhã, they get it and sell part
hmm
you see?
are also those ones drinking, so he
naked
they are metal
that's why the policemen grab and arrest him
You didn't want that one
I told him "you have to pay me money" I said
They said they are going to come on the day we are going to sell (something?)
It's okay, it moved a little bit, but not enough
they were doing something there
this (motor) that we got later (the one they have now)
I sat there alone
It was supposed to be tighted again
I hit her, since I was drunk, I hit her
That string
(he) even gave him his pants
(laughs)
Like yours, right?
but at least he has something to get drunk on
give it here
up to right around Cunuri
you only have to fix it here
ãAa
this is what he's thinking too
in the dark
held around the neck
Both of them
This one also isn't long enough for you guys
I would even hurry, I will come get it later
that guy you know, Orlandino
it's better to measure (gas) with this kind of bucket
she really is
Is that why they've kicked it?
here he went with them and got drunk
It's good, it's really like this
"if I hadn't done it, this wouldn't be happening to me," he thought
the one (where) he's standing, being dragged off
but I only want one swallow and then I'm going"
it does
which? which will be easiest, choose an easy one
um-hum
she's thinking "this is what he did to me"
So, (she) said just that "it will take my soul, don't take photos, don't take photos"
this one, where does it fit in?
(I think) he's really a prisoner, see
for me, I don't give green snake anything
this one might go here, where he arrives and sits there drinking
and right there, to him
ãhʉ
beginning
without water, he said (they said) he passed out
these coconuts, this little trunk, this is a coconut palm
(hundred) fifty
this one here, let's see
hʉ̃
it's [the generator] banging here (hitting)
or sweeping in the morning (ML-P)
planted the fields
Oh really?
That's good
then his being in prison,
said "they came when I was leaving"
She's showing this one here how to do it
he cllimbed up on the hammock and jumped, flew to the window and jumped down from there
fourth cycle (7-8 graders) (ML-P)
Oh boy
What?
at the police station
these, what you said (are) policemen
the chicken's inside
they're drinking, this booze, this is the bottle they're drinking
he might get caught
mMm
after planting, with (the harvest)
this little one is messing things up
going through like they always do, and right there in the channel
here's what follows
I didn't even remember them
I don't know
here he arrived there
hum
yeah
when he went in, they took everything away from him, in prison
now it's a hundred and two
fifty comes up to right there
really bad
ãha
this one here, yeah, he's pooping
he said that?
this is for us to go down
who could they be?
to him, like I talked to others, right?
with the lawyers (REP)
(that) I met
what happened
I asked her, "were you doing that (what people said)?"
is like helping the other one, understand?
Uh-hum
this one stays here
that motor
ready
the last time
a big canoe!
they were going through (the rapids) when the river was a little low
but it didn't go well (and they) fought
Grab on there and lift it up
thinking like that, he remembered, see
I was drunk, that's why I did it,
(and) what about this one, sis?
what did her (their daughter-in-law) father say?
right there
is it the drunks?
one with four liters?
Little cachaça
Only those two aren't sounding so well, this and this aren't playing at all
this one, right?
You know, so many lies people tell
why?
drank with them
maybe the gas ran out, I don't know, yeah
so now you can put a story together
It's okay
he's buying from this one
It looks like they lost this one, that someone took it
with a small one, it was small
to fix this one, only those ones here that are like this
I had been sitting there with no sandals, no clothes
mhum
(to) domingas to vote
what they're doing, in your view
it takes a while (to do) and I don't know how many days you (need to finish)
"it uses a lot" he said (of the motor)
am to blame for these bad things, for getting so drunk
[......] this four
"how would they row to control (the canoe)
this is happening and he's thinking and remorseful
this woman, you said it, here (he's) attacking, attacking
The one in the school?
where he drank
I worked happily
that (person/guy) they say that is a theif
(laughs) "for sixty-eight years you've had a son"
he's always going somewhere
Uh-hum
yes
uh-huh
poor thing, poor thing
oh! poor thing, this one's sick
thinking
hmm
meeting them here
ʉʉ̃ʉ̃
did the guy run off already?
(he) thought, look here at what he's thinking
right here he was arrested
uh
I
(laughs)
I was happy
Like that one, the little pig
then the next morning at eleven-thirty
they're doing that
the next day already, yes, you can get it
There, there are two other ones
so this one goes here
He took his riffle
he's worthless
Twelve years ago the governator told them to build the school separately and gave this generator (to them)
There are others
now this next one
gathered them together
Silvio left already, uh?
uh-huh
have you already gone (to vote)? I'm asking if you went already?
I don't know, now I don't know anything anymore
when he left, they gave his clothes back
(and) I pulled into Taracuá at nine at night
that one
mmm
so the batery too
in his cell
it's 30, right?
we're going to go see, yeah
this guy's thinking about his wife
Yeah
one of my friends came to me
drying like that, like that on top of that, when there was that
Elsa
when his wife's here, she doesn't like it
hã
it does, it does
It says it's going to explode
Ere (Ernesto)
oh! this is where he had already told
look 'carefully' (together) , (you) look too
yes, maybe it belongs there
Uh-hum
(laughs)
here he meets them, here he's drinking with them
Uh-hum
if you do,
In that cozinha
they went (arrived) right here, with the lawyers
hum
hã
it's going to be this long, right?
I threw (something) and missed
so
Tortoise
"I have one, which belongs to my boss"
Still nothing
mMm
ãha
that's still not done
I was really embarassed
what?
thinking here, thinking here, thinking here
this one (or) this one
we can make that tomorrow morning, right?
then we borrowed another fifty
I still haven't signed (ML-P) (ML-P)
There are two over there
Plyers
(laughs)
they didn't wait for us, each one carrying a box
Here it's better to use pitch (a special wax) to close it
Oh well, he took corote (cachoça) and
my friends these guys, and these others
"my son? I have a son?"
I
(and) took me away right then
this one here
Ok
"come" they said
he's thinking
then this fiber comes out separate from the outside leaf
at that time we used a six-meter (boat)
these are bad things
Let's go, one, two, three
Uh-hum
there were those big round tanks, that belonged to FUNAI, this tall
and all the munition, and left
"we won't get there" I told him
and that's the end
right
move over a little, stand up a little you too, yeah
It's not going up, is it?
very pretty
(We could) close it and tight it properly
uh-huh
then wash it well
not her
he wants to stay inside the house
yeah, I don't know how I did it, phiroooo (sound of the boat moving along slowly)
the green it has in
since I was drunk, I didn't realize it
It's all over (the tortoise's life), that's all, right?
we only speak a little
Silvio left
the nun (sister) rosalina ordered me to make something, something small
that rocks (REP)
laughs
one liter to go
ʉ̃ʉ
It's not like this
we need the better ones, these can be thrown away
looking at the photos (drawings)
ok
I thought about it and said to my wife
going (on), let's see this one here
hã
"we speak more or less," he said "but how much does he speak?"
If the rain and storm come
Yeah
they're so lazy
umhum
a male character, a woman, or (one of the) policemen
today, where  (  )
It's not working, throw it in the river, give it to me, I will throw it in the river
ho'o! only that?
here's the payment for the 'chumbo' (weights used for fishing), thirty
it turns black
taking out the fibers, then
that one (gives a little extra)
so I,
so, old one, everything OK?
need glasses (talking about herself)
sandals and clothes
did you walk in the sun?
in there, there he was crying
That one is really heavy
these are his friends
mm, it's really this size
then one day
"I'm going knock the beast down" I said/though (in vain)
yeah (laughs)
laughs
Uh-hum
um-hum
already turning the corner
let's put that one later after he was arrested
the guy is mixed in with them here, like this
Why did you even told them that?
and he only paid back half
pull them out
so I
right here, look
three will be left over
that's it, you're right
he was mad
but we were full "look how you came up, so empty," they say, but we get here almost empty (out of gas)
ãaa
these are the ones who were drinking
that's why he (Cesario)
that is at Taracua, they said that the students that slided it
so, that's it" I thought
<> This one here?
mMm
ãta, just so
there's a risk of catching fire
He didn't stop
go stand over there, as if you weren't dirty (messing aro.nd) >(................(
open it and fold it,
it's gone over (the level)
let's deal with that later
I was
I think he's working in the fields
so they're arresting him (and) his wife
it is
yes
mm
(exclamation of tiredness)
yes, they're policemen
can I start telling the story?
Ernesto who eats lots of fish
he got agressive, here where he's drinking
hummm
poor guy, couldn't say any more, yeah
the motor
then you separate, right?
he's picking vegetables, he's a worker
laughs
I ate happily (well)
and he's thinking like this
ãha
he lost it when he capsized at pacu rapids
this one stays
It would be better if we changed it (generator's diesel) in every 100 hours; lit. 'if you change it every hundred hours, it would be better'
tell (the story) to me, like you're saying "so I did this" you'll tell
It's really almost done
you have to get it at the right time, huh?
(the one) where he's coming back, for sure, right?
He (arsenio) said he had drank
I'm telling you it was there
he took my motor and it disappeared
and said "let's go have some fun too"
(laughs)
mMM
yeah, we're walking around, and you're sitting there relaxing?
They took it with the jacaré (something they use to put the voadeira on), they tied it, they tied it well
and
wow
they let me go, set me free
laughs
look here, it's his emblem
When we put it (the batery) this way
hʉ̃
really where is the beginning
If you want to turn it off, it turns off by itself
another (tank) comes
"I'm coming, I'm coming, these people are here" (still speaking as the other guy)
have you gone already?
on this part of the river, the boat got lighter (after the stop in Ipanoré)
That's the one, right there
Uh-hum
that's all
ãha
I think he's really a prisoner
I think he was assaulting (her) here, look here, for sure
any type of artwork
she's recording like that
50 liters
is over there with some guys
yeah
I was alone there
This one hunted the tortoise, got tired and fell
she accused him, she's thinking
to just below Ipanore, coming around that curve, kʉrʉa! (sound of gas running out)
(not) my children, not my wife
she told them everything
yeah, just doing nothing after going to vote, just sitting here
yeah
Which one is not working? Another one?
here with them
in a downpour
the way to do that is to let the oil go out
um-hum
hum
yes, that's it
ãha
I'm making a souvenir for Dona Kiri, the lady is asking me to
(and) are are those boots?
Say you busted your balls
"to that green snake"
Did the quinhapira bell already ring?
How many must there be? I don't know, 7, 8, I think
for mim, I don't lend to green snake
You're going to need plyers
Okay, then just get married so they will see
Dora's coming back drunk already
ʉhʉ̃
mhm
Daniel's brother-in-law
this card
stop
they haven't come, when they arrive, we'll be coming back
yeah, she's here (with us)
when we don't see well, it's hard
all the green washes out
He arrived with much money
What about the big ones? I saw you had the big ones
this one's the same as the other
getting his things, taking his purchases back
here he's all right with his kids
I want some, Kiri
going off, after he did (what he did) he was arrested
"there with my son,  with my wife
what's that other guy's (name)
hmm
(then) high schoolers (ML-P)
yeah
It's not even green
(but) they were lying to me when they said that
who's next?
Look, Elsa, don't you want some? Give it to her.
then after they said that, they gave me back my
"it takes a hundred (liters to get to Iauaretê)" the soldiers told him "you need a hundred" they said
it's empty
(laughs)
he's sitting thinking about (what happened)
So, let it like this
(shoo-ing)
I just remembered that I have a, a DVD
yes, this one over here
ãha
and us, we're working, right?
you see(agree)?
then here he's drinking again
need to go
my wife was there
so (we'll) start this way
one (tank) runs out, fifty (lts)
look closely
over there, "let's buy gasoline" people say/think (seeing all the tanks and thinking he has gasoline left to sell), but we arrived with empty tanks,
laughs
ʉ̃hʉ
almost out
he, when is wife isn't there, he drinks a lot
you're there just relaxing?
(laughs)
I, I, I
ok
this one
we've just been sitting here since we got back
I wondered "what's going to happen to me?
he wasn't able to say any more (dominate the language)
here, just a little (gasoline left)
when they said that to me, then I
so now, you choose one of the characters as you understood them
Dora's coming back drunk already
that's what he said
With ropes, yes
then another after that, little by little
while you were economizing
at Nogueira I got some
I was thinking like that
remembering
didn't accept their invitation at that time, when they offered
how do we say, I think these are vegetables (and) this is a coconut
ã nine hundred
oh, that's good, chibe
Silia, have you eaten? Go eat.
Oh, yes
one hundred (lts)
they took me to the station
you agree?
Felisberto has other ones
I lent it to him
I don't think they've even eaten, haven't cooked anything
But it's impossible for only two men to carry it
where should it go?
it's empty (finished)
it goes after when he was arrested, over here
when someone says 'thankyou', what, how do we respond?
have you gone (to vote) already?
so I went there
I think this one is attacking, thinking of attacking her
But this part is jumping, it's trembling, right?
they took four boxes of those too
it's quick
declined their offer
I don't know to dance when they've done it, they've done it this very year
This one is good
Armando waits and waits, and then leaves
there's still this one, there's no tank
"I don't know" (W) said
this one has the lawyer, it belongs at the end
Ask him to play it, old man, play it
they are, they're all feeling happy (drunk)
(laughs)
so, when they saw I was hitting her, right there
look isn't it nice?
whitening, it whitens as it dries, whitens
mmm, I'm only going to use this color here in the middle
all the way to the end, you decide
then, when you start to work with it, it's not, it's
Uh-hum
It's fine
if you run it for more time, it (the generator) breaks faster
here he was arrested
this is really the end, these ones, this one is not in the right place
when I was there in jail
for other ones (vendors) 50 liters is just this much
this one seems to speak well, wants to speak more, right?
I was drunk
there at the end of the road (in Ipanorê) the soldiers were watching us
Vila Fátima
have you signed? sign later (ML-P)
Yes, that's why I thought he had let it like this
stays here, done
they're drinking, right?
I don't know, I will measure it later
Imagine, tortoises don't even run
