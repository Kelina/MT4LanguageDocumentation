you see (and) after that (the one where) he was arrested
I was supposed to screw it, right?
He was already dancing (imitating someone)
ʉ̃hʉ
So the batery won't move again
ten liters
um-hum
No
To me, it seems not be charged yet
are you heading up there now?
do you see?
To let it very tight, right?
ãa, yeah, probably a soldier
forty, yeah
hã
it went around and came back here
It's taking so long
this one's here, and this (other one) here
now that you've finished organizing you start telling in order
here he was with his family, he was happy with his family
they got caught in a whirlpool
gonr
"It's me you damn dog, go away!" I said (to no avail)
you learned to make (objects) with that type (of fiber)
still has
we can't buy anything"
the other ones, see(agree)?
I'm going to live well with my family,
we left at nine
yes
with the lawyers
yes, he's woking
they dragged him off and he was full of regret
I told them all that and they told me
let's see, order, order, have we found the order
(I) talked with my wife
you don't do it anymore?
"I sold it to Cocaineiro, he wants it" (E speaking as the guy who lost his motor)
here
yeah
Then I will do the sides
This really wanted to sound(?), that little one still has to be fixed (?)
just like that, he's thinking here
we just still need a wood chopper
I went home, arrived
ãha, he was measuring by what he had given you
This is really good, this is new
in the morning, "how much gas do we have left over"? (the trip leader asked) "nothing, look, of the fifty you borrowed, there just a little bit left" (I said)
and here, could he be thinking?
But he didn't know what else to say and just looked at me, it seemed he knew how to speak, so I talked to him
that tube
(laughs) I'm going to the base
It's left to do another decoration, he said that he would fix it later
the high schoolers (ML-P)
look, he's hitting (her) here
is that right?
are you sitting? (are you here?) (typical greeting)
the
"how would we row?" he said
That batery, I think it's weak
They said the students that have taken it (they slided it)
uh-huh
As for me, I don't know anything, I don't know how they did it when they opened this one here
I'm going to the military base
"I don't know" I said
When it moves, it (the screw) breaks here
to him (Wanderley)
and tortoises don't even run fast
Uh-hum
(he's) a policeman
I told my grandmother Laura
the motor must still be there (at the bottom of the river)
hã
there
wow, wow
ãaa
That one is 12 years old
zʉh (sound of the motor dying)
yes, like this, yes
to open this here, right
yes, his thoughts
crazy
hã
which is next?
"I'm going to give you a charm so everyone will like you" (still the other guy)
he's looking at his garden
that's right
and after that
they aren't
flirting with some guys while you're here
Uh-hum
They are coming, the group
Uh-hum
I, what I did
Where are the kids?
right?
then here he attacks his wife
You go
(no) with their 15 HP motor
there, with the Desano there
I will be like if I was mad
you tell me what you did, what happened to you in this story
he was still living well
And that one that is over there?
um-hum
that's what I told them
I don't know if it will go now
hum
yeah, that's right
this (gas) doesn't have oil mixed in
you were coming directly up?
yeah
do you want chibe?
maybe he's arriving to visit them
you keep looking here
ah, you got there? arrived?
that group's coming
my friends
School
this one is him gathering, to sell over here
yeah, thrown away, and tomorrow we can kick them in
OK
that's right
with her brothers, even with her parents, everyone
this one
ʉ̃ʉ
Later I won't even take a sit, fat old man
to São Gabriel?
yeah, that's how it is even if you're in the middle
(maybe) the motor had a problem
to him, like "your wife, your wife, while you were doing this,
I harvested them, harvested them myself
filled it?
what's he doing, in your view?
vapor
with her, right? I told her "come, we'll go around"
to Armando (to ask him to lend some gasoline)
what?
we, I'm wondering aren't you doing (organizing) like I did
Felisberto has it
what about this one?
he's also thinking
does it have some kind of substance that stays on your hands, yeah?
That string to put it (the flute) together
Hi!
so I was there drinking with them, sitting there drinking, not worried about anything
if I hadn't done it while
leave this one here to see
when she arrives, she can look for me, I'll take her
ãha
we loaded and I pushed off
he's selling sandals, yeah
They are jealous of me, dog, they are jeaous yeah
yes, yes, his thoughts, right?
I don't know how they did it (traveled, with that kind of motor)
ʉ̃hʉ
hã
hã
see the size it should be, not very tight or a little big bigger
Twelve years, now I'm telling I'm going there to get it
ãha
So they said that's from here
that guy's worthless
she turned me in to the police"
squeeze it sort of hard, and then pull
to him, to him they
"is your father-in-law going to buy them or is he taking them on credit?" I said to her
hum, what do you suppose happened?
he started to think
one that just rocks back and forth
and this one?
he was used to a smaller boat
It's past its prime, that's it, its time is over
no, that tukano guy (talking about Jaime)
these two are close to the end
uh-huh
sitting on a bench
when it's a little
railing, right?
wow
"to go from here to Mitu"
I said and thought like this:
like my mom said, the one who was scolding them, why did they do that?
so, to him (these things happened)
I told you that one is broken
(laughs)
mhm
this is where he told, sis
with flat ends
I can't explain because I don't know how to do it, I'm not doing it
in the fields (they say)
that's just the same
No, it's over here
you bet
(laughs)
bastard
from Nogueira (name of a gas vendor)
mm
He already is, Curio?
then it will be (time for) the presentation (ML-P)
stay back, this (gasoline) is dangerous
(ML-P)
we got there 11 at night
He said he was going to do it and bring it (a new generator)
or when you introduce yourselves, if they say there are more teachers, it's not a problem (because some of the teachers were absent) (ML-P)
these were right here
here's the emblem, (and he) has a cap
um-hum
like this are what he caused (to happen)
poor things! they barked some more then shut up
They don't know how to use it, he said it was something simple
yeah, yeah
I think he's gathering (fruit), look at these (fruits)
"and on the way up he borrows some too, I don't know what kind of guy he is" he said
i think it was something nothing really, it's there whole still, right?
speeding up, speeding up and when it's moving, going down a little, regulating it at half speed, coming up some more
Uh-hum
Felisberto's one
and went to see right away
(and) asked
uh-huh
then she went back there and she called me when
Actually, he already is one
hã
yeah
really?
'"when I can pay, I will, tell him" she said
he sitting here
(laughs)
this one stays here
ãha
how high will you make it?
"so take it out of the things to sell" she said
she's telling (them) "he did this to me"
aAã
they can't learn fluently, mmm
and you ended up owing half a liter (to the guy who lent the tank)
and the tortoise was running and he (Silvester) went after him and got really tired
this one is better
really turn over ... we're going to see  (the voting place)
these are the ones who did this, right?
yeah
sent her (voter card)
uh-huh
"while I was there with them
rocking
that's what the people who came down said, hardly anybody they said
there we were and then
yeah, right
that's how it always is, it's hard
the things I planted
over here
too much booze makes (people) behave like that
ok
we're going up
forty or forty-five
(she's) holding her child here for sure
she is, she is
Daniel
how many liters will be left?
"for me to go up too, and you pay for coming down" he said
depending on the weight (of cargo)
it's getting sturdy, isn't it?
here he's sitting (and) thinking, see? yes
they have a blue metal boat
They said she transfered (moved to) São Gabriel
which? (why which? is this not a huh word?
those, I don't know
filming right on her hand
he's harvesting coconuts, yeah
or a little less, eight hundred, like that
in my opinion, this guy
another (tank) comes up
chibe?
wow! (it's full)
that's it
show it there (to the camera)
I just tell us teachers to present (introduce) ourselves (ML-P)
hã
[cough]
it's too hot
looked around
she supports herself doing only this work of hers
then he arrived/met up with, (there with) these guys
When it jumps (*)
this one back again
there, right?
It's good
It's good
"don't take pictures," she said, yeah
hum
ah, yeah
sure
sitting there, he's thinking like this
there's forty here
This one
The white string that is good
I said to him "How are you, are you arriving, my uncle?" (in Tukano)
there are three more
(laughs)
(someone white) came up to me and said, "tudo bem?" (in Tukano)
right, right
like they say we'll just speak 'briefly'  (ML-P)
It's good
The box was above it, it already came like this, they've let it like this, right?
go get them
oh boy, I'm saying, it's really bad actually
how remorseful I felt
and she's thinking this
those with the flat ends
there's a new (closed) leaf at the top, right? then you have to
he already consulted (has been consulted), right?
so then this one is here
and maybe he
Aâ
I went to get more
I think this one here is a salesman, see? he's selling
Is he there?
one took a box, another one did too
but I was already sort of drunk
kʉrʉ! (sound of gas running out) fifty
Eli, uh, they said there was chocolate, check that this morning (ML-P)
afterward we (the teachers) start (introducing ourselves), right?
not very many, I guess they didn't come
wow ... we used five hundred liters, puuu!
(and) her, he was thinking like this
and these like you said, they look like lawyers
Let's fill it all up
"he must be going around with the motor he bought" I mistakenly thought
this one comes back, (the one where) he's thinking isn't he?
"I won't drink again" and they told me
these cards are a kind of game
that guy
that's how we're going to tell it, right?
(laughs)
you're welcome
"Silvio is going to travel tomorrow"
when you leave it two, three days, when it gets rained on
she's thinking, thinking like this
lonely thing
humm
that ones almost running out, isn't it?
But they should have let it better, right?
taking it
so other people say to us "we want to come (along)" we saw (them signaling to us)
Uh-hum
(and) where does this one go?
she already ate
he bought another hundred
to just below Matapi at that island
No, others too
That time, he told us to take it (the generator), Getúlio and I, both tried to carry it, but we couldn't handle it
some water got in (my watch) here, see? how did water get in?
yeah, a big motor, you see
It can't take it, this one is really weak too
that's how it is
this guy
but that's (already) like a real inauguration (ML-P)
this (tank) is all done
right, like you're saying
gosh (laughs)
the fibers start to
I'm a poisonous old guy! (joking with the kids)
she will do it (her work) in one way or another
really, not many people?
later (    ) will arrive
um-hum (here)
said he (their son?) is drinking over there with Rodimar
I said, first I said like "Oh, my mother-in-law," and she
hi!
he's the one selling to them
you see(agree)?
yes
there, there's a big rock and when it's low
all the door stoppers are broken (ML-P)
uh-huh
(with) his thinking
railing, or on a rock, then she when she's done, takes it (the fibers) all out
yes, going there
(expression of surprise)
It's better to play that one, the that has it?
they said
um-hum
we've just arrived
sometimes you turn over in the canoe
I think this is a version of that other one (the same thing happening in another scene)
arrested, the one who was drinking
I almost did myself in
these two sitting
show it in front of you
I had a good life
We arrived and carried it before he went up, he said he was going up
huh?
these ones sat and got really drunk
yes, so now choose a character
these right here
ʉ̃hʉ [campain]
you're going up to the military base, yeah?
are you going?
(laughs)
our products
to, to the trial
(that) it will be 2 days for you to do the work (the one she is manually doing)
yes
(and) this one?
yes
yeah, at the right time
I think these are the ones (  )
a little hot water, then wash, then spread it out
Yes
they were there drinking, not worried about anything
right?
then they took me back to the jail
once,
harvested it
there, this little size
there with the authorities
Come on, is it working?
and he, what's happening
So?
then you- each one will tell the story as if they were that person
can have some fun too, together with our child" I said
yes
The fat old man is really angry
forty-five, forty-five, right doutora?
yes, how is it?
the leaders, (ML-P)
he's like this, right?
maybe it's this stuff
I suffered a lot, and I
is this what he's thinking?
This, this, they don't sound well
humm
put it (the card) there
what
a thought came to me
wow, those are others
I think it's good
where does it belong?
I'm going get married, I'm going to get laid in front of them, that will show them
I was remembering, what I did
that's why that Pari guy said ....
"let's sell these, then we'll have money to spend, we
this one should go here
From elementary school are going to be on vacation, only after everybody is back there will be those things, I said
done
And Paisa laughed so hard, he won't stop
but you shouldn't run it more than 5 hours
yes
from the first
saying that, with them
she's eating quinhapira (fish soup) with her family, isn't she?
Duhu said she wrote it with red ink
what he thought
that's it, is that right?
(laughs)
filled up a tank like this
so I went to her
this is where he was thinking
go ahead, figure it out
Alright
here
yeah, they're sitting in the square, drinking
your daughter-in-law
so, you know (recall) the last time (last workshop)
yeah, they're really not hunters
right here
uh-huh
where he met the guys (and) drank booze
um-hum
that place
I don't give him anything
Do you think it's going to go up?
how (do you suppose) it got in?
(laughs)
that's what I thought
here he's sitting thinking
when I came out shining (my flashlight), the bastard came over here
Oh, good, seventeen
hundred fifty, né
right there
yeah
and put it out to dry
accusing him, I think so
how are you?
I didn't sign (ML-TUK)
she was afraid, (laughs)
she's going to study there (São Gabariel) now
Which ones?
then I hit her
I'm going to put this away
he thought, he might be thinking about asking for forgiveness
"on the way down he (cobra verde) borrows gas"
your materials are all rusty (dirty - covered with chocolate powder that opened during the transportation of the food)  (ML-P)
uh-huh, I've eaten
"there's this much"
Play it?
It's been some time since she's been here?
in a sequence, where it starts
at the house where we were staying
Try it
Silvio said he came
you should say like this: "hai"
maybe here, I don't think it belongs there
his own motor
I'm not even going to talk about this one here (Marino) who doesn't go out (to dance)
people usually loan to him
this little one goes right here, I'm saying
(in) São Gabariel, some times the poor boats are so full the back part is almost submerged - kubo kubo (the sound of the heavy canoe moving through the water)
he's a seller of some things
Then he said, I don't know many he's had, right? He is glutton
no
ãhu
Okay, I'm going to tie it up a little
this is the same person
when she says link this "noana, Kiri"
uh-huh
wow
people also need to sign on Saturday (ML-P)
we start, and afterward
here (is where) he worked, this is where he was thinking,
you really can turn over, so how are you going to row?
yeah, (laughs)
it's really a puzzle, these cards
poor guy, how
wh- on his legs
(laughs)
now, yes
just like that
yeah, antie is giving her soul (being photographed)
laughs
We arrived and carried it
my legs were tied
so here he's sitting (and) thinking
yeah
a brand new Yamaha
the motor used a lot, it was more efficient at half speed
I did like you're doing, filled up the little tank like this one and took it up
ãha
walking around
Cesario?
ãhʉ, human (cachaça) bottles
yeah (laughs)
it's forty, right?
I think
ãha
they
like this is what he did, see?
then he was arrested
and those buckets, how much do they cost in Colombia?
the stuff
(laughs)
my mother-in-law
it's just here
I left that there
he didn't pay me
there he was thinking
I'm sewing and showing
don't ruin those fibers
(laughs)
José, isn't there a pointy thing here?
uuh
Tell him that this kind doesn't run
there's a window there
we're going up in a bit
Play it you too
We are going to do just like that
they just took them?
I don't work with tucum anymore, but have some
must be lying there
twelve
"there's this much gasoline" he said
you're welcome
everything
it's not here, it's over here, sis
it's been like five years
thes ones here, who could they be?
flying up carrying (his stuff)
forty
for me its really HOT
right?
laughs
I'd sure say he's married
she's been studying (there) for a long time already
(laughs)
lazy people's chair
poor old lady was there waiting
the tucum, hu-hum
They were the ones who said it
Wow
they were here barking at me, right over there
what's this? is it a stove?
lots of time also a little, they heat with hot water, cook it a little
they must not be hunters (the dogs)
(he) had gotten a loan of ten thousand two hundred
The old man said that he will fish what he will offer in Dabucuri (a celebration)
to start building up (the sides) and she's just going
humm
is that what was left over from the trip up?
he's sitting there with his head down
It was you who told me, right, Paisa? That she sent a note, oh, Salvador
Let's carry it?
not many
"we don't understand their languages, only a little bit" he said.
this one where he's sitting goes over here, the (bad) guy
mm
Tie with this
leaf, then (she) starts to wash them with soup, with lime juice
don't look for a sad story
OK
he was thinking there, yes, remembering
we went right off
Here there are two pointy things, okay?
That's why you have to screw these ones here
he with the lawyers
and this one here?
That one
I was embarassed and went back down
what you said, he's coming back looking
woah, it smells
Where did you leave the screws?
it is
Do I have to push it?
Then I'm going mix it up with cachaça
like that
If we had pitch, we could just use it
How many centimeters will it be, maybe 20?
he's with his wife, yes
(assulting) him
How did they push this one here, right?
speaks, but not fluently, that's it
there were a bunch of Hupda together (with the soldiers)
hã
The tortoises, when we break them
yes, I think that's it
that, that railing that was there, right? (on the Kotiria School porch)
that guy
wow! the (gasoline) vapors
This one doesn't make any sound
mm
these are the ones who were drinking
you have to, have to, I rem-, I don't rememer, I remember that we separated a whole bunch and left them
laughs, wow, OK
I don't know
that's how he is
we covered up our cargo
my life was like that
(this one) has his thoughts
this one must be together with this one here
"can we get to Iauaretê?" he asked "we won't make it" I said" it will just get us to Ipanore" I said
Charge it only later, let's test it on the afternoon, before taking a ride (?)
it will be just one character, but telling the whole story, right?
in the last workshop, good morning!, in that workshop we had, we (ML-P)
she was standing, the poor (lady), waiting patauá, right, fuck?
no, no, bastard
it was full to the top
he was drunk when he did that, look for sure that's his bottle
There are two here too
I'm telling you it's really impossible
vapor
he's arriving, pode ser this one(ML-P)
uh-huh
I said that now there will only be high school students, and the others
"ok" I said to him
what?
you look, then
"Ok then,
What?
for me this one here
Mm
when I was in prison, I suffered a lot
here is where he went, was arrested, see
we went on
oh, it's, it's the fiber inside, right?
"don't take pictures," she said, yeah
when (my friends) called me
when it's hot, this stuff gets really dry
yeah, that bad one, you should kill him
yes
yes
yes
I've arrived
we (the teachers) will start (introducing ourselves), then the high schoolers (ML-P)
Oh, it was Duhu who said it, right?
so, he got mad (and) came back
(and) hidden, hidden
(laughs)
discolor already, sort of rusty
"yes" she said
right and these are thoughts, right?
aah,  yes
(laughs)
um-hum
we went, and you?
about his family, see?
you enjoying the summer? (=dry season)
teacher at Taracua, that professor Orlandino
ãha
where he was working
"now when we go with the motor, now you young people"
then she washes well, well, very well, if not it has that
They will fix it later
yes, that one, that one, from that place
(laughs)
they were having a good time
who was coming?
It would be better we tighted it up again correctly
here he came back "this is what happened," he's telling
he must be thinking, he's thinking, yes
not for me
"I felt really bad," he said, thinking
does the Tukano have a rabeta (motor)?
Uh-hum
where did (we put) that one?
where are they now, could something have happened?
he went in our bedroom
I think they're doctors, in my view
must not be much
he's harvesting
in the shaft of light, I was sitting, sitting
so where should this one fit in?
"it was like this, it was horrible
yes, (I think) he assaulted his own child, this one here
ãaa
go separating, separating, separating
no
It charged well, it's bright green
it's this one
going in
before we came down, he didn't have any gasoline
How many litters does it take, man (old man)?
yes, we're sitting (we're here) (Tukano?)
right, then he's sitting
her driver, for her to go around
just ask "have you or haven't you eaten?"
Doesn't it work?
here he's arrested
That one is good
do you want chibe?
then (the policeman) is donating his own things to him
you, you're the ones (who will make the food)
nine hundred, around that would be good
"motors are expensive, I'm not going to make a deal for that" I said
standing there looking up
Yes
"here I am in this bad situation, I'm to blame,
(laughs)
a long time, she came just once
look and describe them
ʉhʉ̃
she agreed
(you) have to note down the time you turn (the generator) on
so I
he couldn't say anything more
went to a store we got there
so, did your dog come out?
I got there and asked her
there (at the longhouse)
sometimes she does it crooked and has to undo it and start it over
now it's good, sis
Yes, walking around drunk is called a disease
he's thinking here
Who is the first player?
"when I arrive, I'm going to sell it"
Get it get it
Wow, it must be really heavy
I just stayed there in silence
he would be all right like that
arriving there
I borrowed these (tanks) here from the lizard (nickname of Getúlio)
(he) looks like a policeman
ãha
uh-huh
"You're here, my uncle, we're all well" I said to him, "my uncle, now you've arrived" I said to him.
I'm tired, work, I work a lot
now it's good
got there (Ipanorê) at ten
that's how you see it?
made off with your motor?
I thought: "OK
ãaa
(shoo-ing a chicken)
Yes
first here and going all the way through
led me to do it"
they aren't thinking (about anyone), they're just sitting drinking
went around and came back
those are boots, or aren't they?
he didn't know what to say
and here, she is with the lawyers
Today they will do Dabucuri
I said, said
ask her
hitting, while I was hitting
if we go around drinking, bad things will happen,
yeah, it's already getting sturdy
Out of the canoe?
Mariano
yeah, me too
you can see
they're the shoppers
hʉ̃
um-hum
so this
Those are good, right?
I told the truth "when I did that, all this happened,
I'm telling the truth
his wife,
from what I brought
everybody does, he has a strong charm
Uh-hum
what?
go on
you see(agree)?
they're drinking, that's what you're saying
sometimes we do stop
(laughs)
I think she's accusing him
so, here he's arriving
above, a finger-width above is a full 50 liters
he's joking (laughs)
we got that far
mmm
she's really good, isn't she?
yeah
yeah
I don't know
What? Then they will close it, I will tell them to close it later
Hold those one tight, there, it's good
I (thought) "I'll need this much (gas, to get where I'm going)"
ʉ̃hʉ
they went under, lost it right there
wash
you see? this is out of place, I think it belongs here
"I'll pay you" he said
is he already gone?
that's how it was
Oh this one is good
near the soldiers
Come on, you kids
he's sitting here
cousin, we're going to see, come on
here is where he got agressive
seeing him hitting her, the policemen arrested him
mm
This flute's sound is really hoarse
hʉ̃
This is good, it works
wow
wow! (laughs)
When?
remembering what happened, what you said
I got up
make the lid later, now only make the pot
I'm done
mMm
couldn't kill it, he jumped and went out
those are the same ones who were drinking
uh-huh
Are they?
then one day
Yes, like this
ʉ̃hʉ, (she's) telling
he too had a happy ending
thanks, Kiri
I went back and filled up just like he had diven me "there! that's good" he said
so you two can talk about them
got stuff there and is going back
yeah, that's right
and while I wasn't remembering them
feeling cold!
just three days
(laughs)
yes
he doesn't have boots
they were crossing there and then
ãAa
I couldn't say anything
empty, the boat uses up around one hundred and eight
[..] Laughs
not pliable, you can't stretch it
come drink with us, have some fun"
that's the width, then you start
came once, when it was like, 1982
but he's restrained here, right?
It seems to only take one litter and a half, only that
this is where the lazy people sit
Oh really? You will go out only to curse people around, right?
a small dugout canoe
(I) thought wow! I work (a lot)
no, it's been a long time already
inside, he was really mad
(laughs)
They closed/fixed some things
look there
kha- take (the hose) inside
it wasn't really me, I was drunk, because they got me drunk (gave me booze)
are those the ones?
he's talking about his life like this telling his, telling this
Yes
here he,
"you, your wife
clothes
green from the leaf, right?
this is what was left
batery
near those drinkers
there's one with marking (indicating amounts inside)
ʉ̃hʉ
maybe 15
yesterday, were they barking at you (old one)?
you explain to her
you'll come right back here"
uh-huh
"you do, for a long time" (laughs)
uh-huh
uh-huh
He won't stop?
they were
there I was
ask her "have you eaten?"
Silvio said "he arrived at the same time"
Yeah
the weight
I told them (my family) that
so, hearing that, I said "What! is that so?"
(laughs
"if that hadn't happened I wouldn't be here" he's thinking
but here she is
I thought about (what happened)
"leave the oars, leave them all to the side," he said "hold on to the oar" he said
"how much will you pay me? " (Wanderley) asked
what?
ã, buying (for themselves)?
"went to get more"
(laughs)
this (tank) doesn't measure correctly, they should buy better ones
that way, here he's coming back
then you use up gas (as you come upriver)
Felisberto?
then it seems like he's out walking around with his son, I think
she's showing her skills
we should choose a character?
Sergio, about what we're doing at the end, how are we going to organize that later on? the number (musical presentation) (ML-P)
arrested him and took his clothes
(with) empty tanks (the boat) floats (is light in the water)
and got really drunk
Like a balsa, that goes down floating
It's good to those old people
Now is it fine?
I said, warning (him)
I'm leaving them here
when it's dry, get it
they turned me in
all right
so she used to teach her mother-in-law, her mother-in-law... hum (was) so slow
yes, arresting him
"I lived well" he must have thought
so (he) got worried "I'm going to stop the trip, it's taking too much" he said
"I did all of that" he said
Mr. Amos would like to give me that one (a generator), this time I'm going there to get it
ʉhʉ̃
mMm
like, as a bad joke said he found a
Caxirí (an alcoholic drink)
It will close them later
(jumped up) on your board (side of the bed?), that one
here he's sitting in jail
so, knowing that, I (said) to them
He didn't stop, right?
This one is really like this
(laughs)
those boxes they carry
I would never do (that)
I have no one family here, no one
thought you were lying
she's not giving her soul
a lot of vapor
must not be many
your brother's wife is that one
it's been a while, two years ago, three years already
Pig (nickname), do you call drinking too much a disease, right?
two hundred fifty, two hundred forty
and I got dressed again
drinking
look there, where is that one
this is poison, this is poison
for the presentation, how?, ʉ̃ʉ̃ (ML-P)
ãha
just to ask
(it started with) the high schoolers, high schoolers, no- the third cycle group (5-6 graders) (ML-P)
big beer boxes, the other ones took those
that's right, you look here too, yes
then, when it rains, it gets even whiter, uh-huh
they (some people) just arrived in a big canoe
who are they?
Yeah, I'm going there take it with ASEKK'(s boat) (an school organization), that carries heavy cargos
is that where they sit?
do you see(agree)?
I don't know
their booze, understand?
okay?
we struggled to pull (the boat and cargo) onshore, puh! (sound of heavy things landing on the ground)
ten liters
yes, then you will build up the sides
completely full
"when I was free there with my family, I was fine"
with two hundred fifty liters inside, (the guy asked) "is that enough to get there? will there be some left over?" (but) it wasn't enough
wow, it's so hot
Ah! look at that chicken, (laughs)
ãha
yeah, that's it
This one is like this
it's good
over there
this goes here, this runs back here
he asked his wife
tell her
the (real) opening (ML-P)
it was small, small-
a bunch of them came (and) arrested me
yeah, do you see?
it's cold
what about this one here?
thinks "how will I ask for forgiveness?" he might be thinking like that
there's still this woman here
(laughs)
like that, he
no, no, no, not in there, he went inside our house
I was there with my wife
"your son is coming, wait right there" I said
Yeah
right, it's here, right?
telling my son "don't ever do what I did,
then I thought "how will we have fun in the city? for us
are your parents home
before (my troubles) I worked hard (and) liked to work
she went to him: "see what you did" she said
It has been a while since he told me to take it, but two
yeah, it's pretty bad
yes, attacking (her) yes
"won't get there" I said
how can he get through the rapids with that canoe
they were buying
my daugther-in-law is even faster
"I'm going to São Gabriel" he said
we're going to take this over there
This is good, that one, close that little one there
I was wrong thinking he had paid it off with the money
with his friends
(In Portuguese) This buddy Silvester was funny
um-hum
ãhu, that's the one
to row
after she agreed, we made these little things
she's doing it the right way, (laughs)
What?
Yeah, now push
Elsa, when she starts (working) everything starts, she starts working, she does it fast
Lift it up a little bit
Who knows where he dropped the bowl
where/how does it end?
Yeah, it's good
go separating, separating, separating
He passed out drunk just there
what I did, she told them
you
Is this one strong?
what's antie doing?
(when I went to give it back) filling it up, there was a little bit less
hum
on the calender
I shined (the flashlight on them), didn't have anything to throw at them, I looked around (unsucessfully)
now let's look at this one
you put it there?
yeah that's the stuff I am taking inside (the storeroom)
Have you put it?
how is it?
Slide it, let's throw it in the river
uh-huh
With that one, they took it and turn it (?)
he's not, in my view, he's a policeman
getting there,
it is, yes it's his wife, yes
but I can't remember what's next
in the story, you
laughs
my sandals, my
maybe she's sewing, doing it bit-by-bit
he's remembering what happened, look here
do you see(agree)?
"I will never do that again," he thought
for me, I use one tank in my old one (motor)
thank you
done
How will they decorate it?
there he thought and went quickly (to the policemen)
Let's paint them
umm
I hit our child, knocked them down
who?
were they going to sell it there? (changing the subject, talking about the cargo in the big boxes)
I
yeah, that dog
Come on, Daniel, to help push
eight hundred, around that
uh-huh
coming up as if not carrying anything
with his family
doing (something), what's he doing, it seems
his thoughts too, yes
After that
here
(and) his little child
I chased him off
but they insisted, "come quickly
For someone who doesn't know anything, you are really full of yourself
Ãa
I don't know for sure, I didn't check yesterday
Uh-hum
It will work right yeah
"I'm a dog!" I said, but they didn't recognize me
I got there and she was holding my child
"This one here can speak well" he said, "can he really?" I said to him
in your view, where should these go? these cards
when we do that, it (the diesel) lasts four months after we turn it on
did she say "yes"?
what?
She is indeed really crazy
he does have boots, aren't these boots?
yeah, that we need to go back
It already comes with it attached, that's why there is no way
(laughs)
yeah carrying empty tanks (up to the house) (laughs)
